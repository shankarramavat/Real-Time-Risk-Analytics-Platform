New Features to Add
1. User-Facing Mobile Integration
Feature :
In-App Fraud Alerts : Push notifications for users to confirm suspicious transactions (e.g., "Did you spend $500 at Merchant X? Reply YES/NO").
Biometric Verification : Trigger fingerprint/face ID checks for high-risk transactions.
Tech : Integrate with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and device-native authentication APIs.
2. Account Takeover (ATO) Detection
Feature :
Detect credential-stuffing attacks or unauthorized logins using:
Behavioral Biometrics : Keystroke dynamics, mouse/touchscreen patterns.
Device Reputation : Flag logins from new devices or TOR networks.
Tech : Use libraries like PyOD for outlier detection in behavioral data.
3. Synthetic Fraud Simulation
Feature :
A "Red Team Mode " to simulate sophisticated attacks (e.g., distributed fraud bots, deepfake voice scams).
Generate synthetic fraud patterns (e.g., mimicking ransomware-linked transactions).
Tech : Use reinforcement learning (RL) agents to act as adaptive adversaries.
4. Real-Time Model Uncertainty
Feature :
Quantify model confidence scores (e.g., "90% certain this is fraud") to prioritize analyst reviews.
Flag transactions where the model is uncertain (e.g., new fraud patterns).
Tech : Implement Monte Carlo Dropout in neural networks or Bayesian models.
5. Cross-Border Fraud Mitigation
Feature :
Detect currency arbitrage fraud (e.g., exploiting exchange rate delays).
Flag transactions violating sanctions lists (OFAC, UN) using real-time APIs.
Tech : Integrate with OpenSanctions or Chainalysis for crypto transactions.
6. AI-Powered Dispute Resolution
Feature :
Auto-generate fraud reports for chargebacks using NLP (e.g., summarize transaction history).
Suggest next steps for users (e.g., "Freeze card? Block merchant?").
Tech : Use LangChain or GPT-3.5 for report generation.
7. Decoy Transactions (Honeypots)
Feature :
Inject fake high-value transactions into the system to lure and identify fraudsters.
Track entities interacting with decoys for network analysis.
Tech : Use AWS Honeycode or custom logic in Kafka streams.
8. Multi-Modal Anomaly Detection
Feature :
Combine voice fraud signals (e.g., IVR scams) with transaction data.
Detect phishing attempts via NLP analysis of user-reported emails/SMS.
Tech : Integrate speech-to-text APIs (e.g., Deepgram) and sentiment analysis.
9. Dynamic Network Visualization
Feature :
Real-time graph visualization of fraud clusters (e.g., linked accounts, mule networks).
Highlight "suspicious communities" using community detection algorithms.
Tech : Use Gephi or Neo4j Bloom for interactive graphs.
10. AI Ethics & Fairness Layer
Feature :
Monitor model bias (e.g., flagging certain demographics disproportionately).
Auto-adjust thresholds to ensure fairness across user groups.
Tech : Use IBM’s AI Fairness 360 or Fairlearn libraries.
Updated Prototype Workflow
Simulate ATO Attack : Trigger a login from a new device → system requests biometric verification.
Honeypot Demo : Show a fraudster interacting with a decoy transaction → system flags their IP.
Cross-Border Fraud : Detect a transaction violating sanctions → auto-block and alert compliance.
Explainability 2.0 : Display model confidence scores + SHAP values in the dashboard.
Judging Impact
Wow Factor : Honeypots, biometric verification, and adversarial simulations showcase proactiveness.
Scalability : Edge AI and federated learning ensure global deployment readiness.
Ethics : Fairness monitoring aligns with regulatory trends (EU AI Act).
